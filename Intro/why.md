# Why we bother with cybersecurity
## Huge data breaches
 The average data breach costs in 2022 is $4.35 million, a 2.6% rise from 2021 amount of $4.24 million, not only it is really costly but also will give the company a really bad image, and also it often put people lifes at risk.

 ## Hacker often target critical areas
 ### Areas attackd by hackers
 - Transport 
 - Energy
 - Basic need infra (water supply etc.)
 - Communication infra

 as you notice all theses areas are mandatory for the normal functioning of any country, you take one out and everything falls.

 all this to say that even thoo cybersecurity is till regarded as a plus we need it anyway
