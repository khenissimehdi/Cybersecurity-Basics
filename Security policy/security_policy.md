# Security policy

## Security Policy - Documentation

- Formalize access procedures for computer resources and information in general.
- Backup procedures.
- Document physical and logical network and system architectures.

## Security Policy - Protection

- Establish security perimeters
- Create access points and filter entries (implement means of protection)
- Identify and authenticate users

## Security Policy - Management and Monitoring

- Track user rights attribution and revocation (passwords, smart cards)
- Trace operations and transactions
- Regular vulnerabilities audit
- Permanent intrusion attempts audit

## Security Policy - Training and Information

- Train personnel on security policy implementation
Appoint an Information System Security Officer (ISSO)
- Inform personnel about "social engineering" techniques based on trust abuse
Rule: Users are individually responsible for understanding and complying with the security procedures for the systems they use (computers and networks). They can be held accountable for their behavior.

## Security Policy - Policy Construction
Steps:

- Audit and document
- Document network and system architecture
- Establish resource list
- Establish user list by resource and define their - access level
- Establish list of global and resource-specific threats
- Define security policy
- Define and implement means of protection
- Security Policy - Construction
- Documenting Architecture
- Security starts with a network architecture designed with this objective.
- Clear and precise vision of existing network connections, available computer resources, and users of these resources must be established.
- All possible accesses must be recorded and then deleted or secured.
- Adding new entry points to the network must be part of the security policy implementation monitoring process.

## Security Policy - Construction
Audit: Resource List
A resource list must be established.
This list includes all systems and servers as well as all active network elements (routers, switches, etc.).

## Security Policy - Construction
Audit: Information List

- Identify physical storage locations for information.
- Identify all means of accessing this information.
- Classify information by criteria
    - availability
    - integrity
    - confidentiality
## Security Policy - Construction
### Audit: User List
- The user list includes all existing or potential  network users.
- Their access rights to different resources must be specified.

### Audit: Threat List
- The threat list includes global or common threats to the entire network and specific threats to individual resources.

### Moyens de protection:

- Les systèmes certifiés de sécurité intégrée dans le code
- Filtrage sur équipements actifs
- Firewall, serveurs d'authentification, VPN, anti-virus, anti-malware, réponse juridique
- Configration respectant la politique de sécurité
- Centralisation de la sécurisation des accès via firewall, serveurs d'authentification, SSO, serveur de clés PKI.
